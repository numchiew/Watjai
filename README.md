ECG monitoring with BLE on android version M. 

Full System + API can found on this Repo : https://github.com/OjoSirisak?tab=repositories

Use Pans Tomkin method to analyse Arrthymia rythm. 

For Arduino circuit. I use E-health Shield + EKG sensor + Arduino + HM-10 for transfer data to mobile.

Arduino work on 160 sampling rate with ble to send data to show a RealTime ECG on Mobile. (depends on your noise cancellation circuit but an ECG signal was very clean on my device connection.)

can detect a heart_rate but still got a problem to analyse QRS complex.
