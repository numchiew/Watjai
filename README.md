ECG monitoring with BLE on android version M. 

Use Pans Tomkin method to analyse Arrthymia rythm. 

next work 

1. re-write Pan Tomkin from Java to Javascript to run on RestFul Api 
2. do Low-pass / High pass filter on hardware device to decrease data length. (sampling rate 250 / sec is too much for arduino+ble)
